Using machine learning to predict listing price for Airbnbs

- This was previously one of many half-complete projects sitting on my computer. Hoping to get some more out and build out my portfolio more!
- The notebook includes some EDA, feature engineering, and feature selection techniques before running predictions on a variety of machine learning models.
- The requirements file includes generic pytorch with CPU, I use a simple neural network in this project that the CPU can handle it. Exploring deep learning a bit further may require moving toward training the model via GPU instead.
- The dataset itself was pulled from Kaggle [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipeshkhemani/airbnb-cleaned-europe-dataset/data)
